# CSP_RUST
Boilerplat code to generate CSP compatible structs to communicate with parts that require the CSP format over UART/serial and CANBUS sockets


-TO-Do:
  1. implement mission hardware specific code (commands via CSP)
  2. implement CANBUS an UART code for distributing CSP packets into CANFrames
  3. test code
  4. implement into prototype system
  5. implement into Kubos GraphQL services for data aggregation


OLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Using an existing rust CPS implementation crate
