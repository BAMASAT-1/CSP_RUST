# CSP_RUST
Boilerplat code to generate CSP compatible structs to communicate with parts that require the CSP format over UART/serial and CANBUS sockets


TO-Do:
  implement mission hardware specific code (commands via CSP)
  implement CANBUS an UART code for distributing CSP packets into CANFrames
  test code
  implement into prototype system
